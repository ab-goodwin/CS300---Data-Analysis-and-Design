### DSA: Analysis and Design
##
#### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
##### This course covered various data models—binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists—and their practical applications in software development.    
##
#### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
##### I focused on understanding and comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of utilizing each data structure, applying them when their advantages outweighed any limitations.
##  
#### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
##### I resolved issues by researching different examples and uses of the method I struggled with. Sometimes, I just created a simple prototype to test the basics, then built on it as the course progressed.
##
#### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
##### Big-O analysis made me more mindful of performance and how to approach algorithmic design. It also highlighted that I don’t always use the most linear path to the solution.
##
#### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
##### I believe all these skills develop with practice. I’ve written enough programs to optimize and make good use of notations to make it readable. My previous assignments have been useful as I can replicate certain pieces of code that require only minimal changes to variables to make use of in a new program.
